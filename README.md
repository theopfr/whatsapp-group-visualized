## üßë‚Äçüíª Data Extraction
Before using this tool, you'll need to:
1. Export your WhatsApp group chat data.
2. Format it for use with the dashboard.

See the [DATA_EXTRACTION.md guide](./DATA_EXTRACTION.md) for full instructions. You will end up with a single .csv file.

## üì• Installation
You can either run the project locally using a Python virtual environment or spin it up quickly with Docker.

### Option 1: Local Setup (Python)

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:theopfr/whatsapp-group-visualized.git
cd whatsapp-group-visualized
```

#### 2. Create a virtual environment
Using uv (or use venv/virtualenv if you prefer):

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Docker Setup
You can run the entire app using Docker Compose.

If you haven't cloned the repo set up your project directory:
```bash
mkdir my-whatsapp-visualizer
cd my-whatsapp-visualizer
```
Then copy these files from the repo:
- docker-compose.yml ‚Üí ``my-whatsapp-visualizer/docker-compose.yml``
- data/config.json ‚Üí ``my-whatsapp-visualizer/data/config.json``

Your folder structure then should look like:
```
my-whatsapp-visualizer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
```

The image will be installed the first time you start docker-compose, but you can also do it manually:
```bash
docker pull TODO
```

## üìä Preparing Your Data
After you followed the [DATA_EXTRACTION.md guide](./DATA_EXTRACTION.md), place the csv file into your ``data/`` folder and make sure its named ``group-chat.csv``.

Then, add all the relevant data to the ``./data/config.json``. It is already filled with examplary data and consist of the following:
- the groups name (must not match the actual name on WhatsApp)
- the ``jidMap``: Maps the sender-ids to name-identifiers which will be shown in the visualization, this needs to be done manually (must not match the actual names on WhatsApp)
- ``other``: Names to be grouped into a "other", for example for inactive users (names must have been defined in ``jidMap``)
- ``excludeOthers``: Wether to show data for the "other" or ignore in in the visualizations
- ``senderAliases``: Aliases/pet-names for the senders, needed to visualize who mentions who the most even when not addressing them with the real name
